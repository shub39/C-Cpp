/*
 * Detective Arjun was well-known in his village for his sharp mind and quick
thinking. One sunny morning, he received a call from the local jeweler, Mr.
Gupta. Mr. Gupta had discovered two identical-looking jewel boxes, each
containing a collection of precious gems. The legend said that only if both
collections of gems were exactly the same, could the box with the true hidden
gem be opened. To solve this mystery, Detective Arjun needed to verify that both
collections had the same set of gems. The order of gems didnâ€™t matter, but if a
gem appeared more than once, it had to appear the same number of times in both
boxes. Can you help Detective Arjun determine if the collections in the two
boxes are equal?
