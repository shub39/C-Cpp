break statement:

    The break statement is used to exit from a loop (like for, while, do-while) or a switch statement.
    When encountered inside a loop, it immediately terminates the loop and transfers control to the statement immediately following the loop.
    It is commonly used to exit a loop early based on some condition.

continue statement:

    The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration.
    It is commonly used to skip certain iterations based on some condition.

exit function:

    The exit function is used to terminate the entire program and return control to the operating system.
    It immediately terminates the program without executing any further statements in the program, including any pending return statements from functions.
    It's important to note that exit is a function, not a statement, and it requires the stdlib.h header to be included.
